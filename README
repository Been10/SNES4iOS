Emulators for various platforms have been available for years on the iOS platform, but they’ve always required the user to jailbreak their devices. Thanks to Spencer Nielsen (@snielsen42 http://www.aorensoftware.com/blog/2011/05/23/play-snes-games-on-your-ipad-without-jailbreaking/), an SNES emulator for iOS is now available, albeit only for developers.

This port is a modified version of SNES--HD- by WoozleWrangler, found here:

https://github.com/WoozleWrangler/SNES--HD-

This provided the vast majority of the Objective-C code. Some improvements found in this version include:

•iTunes FIle Sharing support
•Universal app to support iPhone in addition to the already included iPad.
•Incorporates the functionality of ControlPad (http://github.com/WoozleWrangler/ControlPad) into the same binary, so you don’t need to keep track of two apps.

But skipping past all that, here are the big features of this port at this time:
•Universal app to play all SNES ROMs on your iPhone and iPad.
•When playing on your iPad, you use an iPhone/iPod Touch to control it.
•Load ROMs through iTunes File Sharing, or by downloading them from within the app.
•Saves your ROM data through .srm files.
•iPhone/iPod Touch offers two orientations to control game: portrait and landscape (iPad is only landscape).
•Save states available for iPad (coming soon to iPhone/iPod Touch)

Known issues:
•Although saving states is supported on the iPhone, there’s no way to load them at this time.
•Quitting a ROM crashes the app (but if you’re quitting the ROM, surely this doesn’t matter that much right? :P)
•Occasionally crashes upon launching a ROM. Just relaunch the app and keep trying until it works.
•The iPad can only connect to the iPhone the first time the connection popover appears. Any subsequent times for some reason can’t find the phone.
•Same with the iPhone, only the first time the popup appears on the controller view can you connect with the iPad.
•There’s an iCloud toggle in the iPad app, but it doesn’t do anything since I haven’t added iCloud support yet.

Features to come:
•iCloud support, so you can sync your game saved data across devices :)
•Ability to control the iPad without having to use an iPhone/iPod Touch.
•Save states for iPhone/iPod Touch.
•Ability to load a save state from within the ROM.

So for now get to compiling and enjoy your SNES emulator without having to jailbreak!

If you want to contribute…

The actual emulator code seems to crash for various reasons, and I haven’t had time to look through it all. The compiled emulator code the app uses is located in /src/snes4iphone_src/. I’ve included the original src files before I compiled them using the “make” command in /original_src/snes4iphone_src. If you want to change the code there, cd into that folder in Terminal and type “make” without the quotes. NOTE: To compile it you MUST have the iOS SDK 4.3 or lower installed at /Developer/ on your mac  (but you only have to have it located there for the compiling, a simple renaming of folders can achieve this). Making the emulator code requires GCC 4.2.1 which Apple no longer includes with the iOS5+ sdks.
